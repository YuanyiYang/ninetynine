Welcome to ninety-nine additional card game! It's a simple game and I am working on implementing it!
Here is a brief introduction about the rule.
At the beginning, each player is given five cards. During the game, the value of each card 
played is added to a running total which is not allowed to exceed 99. A player who cannot 
play without causing this total to surpass 99 loses. After each player places a card 
as a discard pile, he/she should draw a new card. Fail to do so will make you have fewer cards 
than others, which is an obvious disadvantage. Also the player who has no card to play loses.
Cards of certain ranks have special values or properties, which are:
4: value is 0 and the order of play is reversed.
7: exchange your cards with someone else and both of you cannot draw a new card.
10: value is -10, or +10.
J: draw a card from anyone else to become your card and he/she cannot draw a new card
Q: value is -20, or +20.
K: added up to 99
